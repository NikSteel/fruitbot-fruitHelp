## frutiHelp API

The fruitHelp API by Nik Steel makes a list of all available fruit and includes functions for working with those,
such as calculating the distance between a player and a piece of fruit, choosing the fruit that has
the minimum distance, and choosing a player action to move towards the targeted fruit with the minimum path.

A description of the available functions and their usage is in the fruitHelp_api.js file in this repo.
